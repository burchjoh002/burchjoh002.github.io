<p>This 24 page research paper is an evaluation of the Electoral College in America, and why it is no longer necessary in today's world.

The graded assignment required an abstract, 3 counter arguments with refutations, a conclusion, a works cited page, and survey results copied. Beyond the requirements, there is a contextual history section as well as an evaluation of a current measure to subvert the Electoral College. This paper is written in APA 7th Edition format.</p>
