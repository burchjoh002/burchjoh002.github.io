<center><p>I am a senior at South Lyon East High School. I like to challenge myself in school by taking rigorous courses and maintaining great grades. I will be attending the University of Michigan to study Business in 2024. The University of Michigan has been my goal for years, and I am thrilled to study there. I plan to join the Marching Band. My current activities and hobbies are detailed below.

  <h4>Symphony Band; Bass Clarinet</h4>
  <p>In 2022 and 2023 we earned a Division Rating II at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd1X7nPsM4Q">MSBOA</a> District Festival. My favorite song we have played is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeFiOnbKYcc">Danzon No. 2</a> by Arturo MÃ¡rquez, with a close second being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd1X7nPsM4Q">Stella Maris</a> by Samuel R. Hazo.</p><br>
  <h4>Concert Band; Tenor Saxophone</h4>
  <p>I joined Concert Band this year to learn and improve my Tenor Sax skills, as I will be auditioning for the University of Michigan Marching Band on Tenor Sax.</p><br>
</div>

<h2>Honors Bands & All state</h2>
<p>I am the First Chair Bass Clarinetest for the MSBOA District 4 Honors Band. I have participated in this honors band since it's return from Covid.</p>
<p>I also was accepted into the MSBOA All-State Band! This required a ridiculously hard audition, and I was auditioning against musicians across the state! I was accepted into the All-State Band on Contrabass Clarinet, and am first chair! This means I am the most skilled Contrabass Clarinetist across the state! You can read about my All-State audition <a href="https://jdburch.com/All-State/">here</a>. A blog post about my All-State experience is in the works!</p><br>

<h2>Marching Band</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 25px;">
  <h4>High School Marching Band</h4>
  <p>I am a Captain of the Single Reeds Section in the SLEHS Marching Band, and play Bass Clarinet. Our marching band is in the <a href="https://www.themcba.org">MCBA</a> Flight II, and we were state finalists in 2021, 2022, and 2023</p><br>
  <h4>College Marching Band</h4>
  <p>I am planning on auditioning for the Michigan Marching Band in June. I am learning Tenor Sax to play in college marching band!</p><br>

<div style="margin-left: 25px;">
  <h4>Duets</h4>

  <h4>Clarinet Choir</h4>
  <p>In Fall 2022, I joined our school sponsored Clarinet Ensemble. We performed at our school's Winter Concert, Spring Concert, and for a nursing home. We earned a 1 at District Solo and Ensemble, and unfortunately got disqualified at State Solo and Ensemble due to not covering all the parts in the piece; however, we did get glowing comments from the judge! This year, we will be performing at District (and hopefully State) Solo and Ensemble, as well as various concerts like last year.</p><br>
  <h4>Sax Choir</h4>
  <p>In Fall 2023, I joined Sax Choir to keep improving on Tenor Sax! We will be performing at the same events as Clarinet Choir!</p><br>

<h2 id="swim">Swimming</h2>

<p>I am a Captain on the South Lyon Varsity Swim and Dive Team. I mainly swim the 100 Breastroke and the 100 Butterfly. I have been Varsity all 4 years of high school.</p>

<h2 id="scouts">Scouts - Youth</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 25px;"> <h4>Trail to Eagle - Blue Troop</h4>
 
  <p>In 2019, I joined Blue Troop at Trail to Eagle. Trail to Eagle is a very unique summer camp that takes place once a week. Scouts from across Michigan and the country are seperated into one of eight differnet troops named after a color. I was in Blue Troop for 5 years as a youth. In 2021, I was asked to be a Junior Assistant Scoutmaster. I served as a JASM for two years. Trail to Eagle 2022 was one of the best weeks of my life! I earned over 25 merit badges over the 4 years I was at TTE!</p><br>

  <div style="margin-left: 25px;"> <h4>Eagle Scout Project</h4>
    <p>In the summer of 2022, I completed my Eagle Scout Project. This patio was just under 100 square feet. It took months of planning and around 75 hours of personal service. I fundraised by organizing a can drive during the week of the Fourth of July on my grandma's street (she lives on a lake, so it was a great location). I also got funds from Thrivent Credit Union through a member of my church.</p><br></div>

<h2>Scouts - Adult</h2>
<p>In 2024, I will be returning to Trail to Eagle as an Assistant Scoutmaster for Blue Troop. Rather than becoming a merit badge counsler, I will be joining the Med Staff! I will be training with Rod Beckwith and Gordy throughout the year so that I can learn the necessary first aid and lifesaving skills necessary.</p><br>

<p>I listen to many podcasts by <a href="https://relay.fm">Relay FM</a>. I am very active in the Relay FM Members discord, where I have met many friends over the past few years.

<h2 id="jude">St. Jude's Fundraisers</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 25px;">
  <p>Every September, Relay FM organizes a huge fundraiser for St. Jude's Childrens Research hostpitlhas a large fundraiser for St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital. This fundraiser raises an incredible amount of money each year. Their lifetime total is just shy of $3 Million over 5 years.</p>
  <p>In 2022, they opened the fundraiser up for individual community members to have their own sub-campaigns. I started a campaign, and in my campaign, if somebody donated $10 or more, I would mow their name into a lawn before cutting all the grass. I would dedicate that lawn to them and donate half of the money I earned from mowing that lawn. My fundraiser raised $625. The link to the fundraiser is <a href="https://jdburch.com/2022">here</a>.</p>
  <p>During September 2023, I ran a similar campaign with Relay FM again. This year, I donated my total earnings for 1 lawn for every $200 raised (up to $1000 raised). My campaign raised $1,521.01, smashing my total last near by nearly 3x. This link is <a href="https://jdburch.com/2023">here</a>. I am so proud of how much I have raised and I am incredibly impressed with the entire Relay FM community</p><br>

<h2 id="ranger">Junior Ranger Program</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 25px;">
  <p>The Junior Ranger Program is a program at <a href="https://nps.gov">National Park Sites</a> that grants kids more opportunities to participate and learn about their National Parks. You complete a series of activities about the park in a workbook, and then show the completed activities to a Park Ranger. From there, you earn a Junior Ranger Badge and are a Junior Ranger of that National Park Site. I am a Junior Ranger at over 250 NPS Sites across the nation.</p>
